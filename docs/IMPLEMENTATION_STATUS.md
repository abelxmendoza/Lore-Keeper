1. Identity Pulse - Sentiment trajectory, drift detection
2. Relationship Analytics - Graph algorithms, centrality
3. Saga Engine - Memory clustering, arc detection
4. Memory Fabric - Similarity graph, community detection
5. Insight Engine - Correlations, behavioral loops
6. Prediction Engine - Mood forecasting, risk zones
7. Shadow Engine - Suppressed topics, shadow archetypes
8. XP Engine - Gamification system
9. Life Map - Global view combining all analytics
10. Search Engine - Combined keyword/semantic search

**Migration**: `migrations/20250201_analytics_system.sql`  
**API Routes**: `apps/server/src/routes/analytics.ts`  
**Services**: `apps/server/src/services/analytics/`

### 4. Backend-Frontend Connections ✅
**Status**: Fully Connected

- Memory Graph connection (`/api/memory-graph`)
- Continuity Panel connection (`/api/continuity/*`)
- Entry editing UI (PATCH `/api/entries/:id`)
- Voice memo upload (POST `/api/entries/voice`)
- Chapter candidates display (GET `/api/chapters`)

### 5. Blueprint Implementation ✅
**Status**: Mostly Complete

**Completed**:
- Database schema (adapted to existing structure)
- Core services (conversation, memory extraction, knowledge graph)
- API endpoints (under `/api/memory-engine`)
- Background jobs (daily insights, weekly graph updates, memory extraction worker)

**Missing/Incomplete**:
- Continuity Engine Check job (contradictions, abandoned goals, new arcs)
- Local ML models (using OpenAI embeddings instead)
- Frontend components (Memory Explorer UI, Insight Dashboard)

**See**: `BLUEPRINT_STATUS.md` for detailed status

### 6. Code Cleanup ✅
**Status**: Complete

- Removed 3 unused files (~416 lines)
- Fixed duplicate imports
- Verified all remaining code is active
- Added linting rules to prevent duplicates
- Created automated unused code detection

**See**: `docs/CODE_CLEANUP.md` for details

### 7. Testing Infrastructure ✅
**Status**: 80% Complete

- 17 test files created
- 98+ test cases written
- 79 tests passing (80% pass rate)
- Security tests 100% complete
- Test infrastructure established
- CI/CD integration ready

**See**: `docs/TESTING.md` for details

### 8. CI/CD Pipeline ✅
**Status**: Fully Configured

- Main CI pipeline with all test jobs
- Security tests workflow
- Code quality checks workflow
- Automated duplicate detection
- Unused code analysis
- Status checks for PRs

**See**: `docs/CI_CD.md` for details

## In Progress

### Frontend Components
- Memory Explorer UI enhancements
- Insight Dashboard
- Graph visualization
- Component relationship viewer

### Continuity Engine
- Detect contradictions
- Detect abandoned goals
- Detect new arcs forming

## Future Enhancements

### Local ML Models
- sentence-transformers for embeddings (cost savings)
- DistilBERT for sentiment analysis
- sklearn clustering algorithms

### Advanced Features
- Real-time analytics updates (WebSocket)
- Export analytics as PDF/CSV
- Comparison analytics (period over period)
- Component relationships/graph
- Component merging/deduplication

## Implementation Notes

### Cost Optimization
- Rule-based first approach (>60% cases avoid LLM)
- Aggressive caching (detection, extraction, embeddings)
- Background processing (non-blocking)
- Batch operations
- **Current estimated cost**: ~$0-5/month

### Performance Optimizations
- Character list: 2-5s → 200ms (10-25x faster)
- RAG packets: 500ms-5s → 10-50ms (50-100x faster)
- Tag extraction: 500ms → 10ms (50x faster)
- Most operations are 10-100x faster than before

### Architecture Decisions
- **Rule-based first**: Minimize API costs by using pattern matching
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching to avoid redundant processing
- **Background processing**: Defer expensive operations to reduce latency
- **LLM fallback**: Only use when rule-based insufficient
- **Batch processing**: Process multiple items together for efficiency
