## Core Systems Explained

### Omega Persona Engine

**What it does:** Makes Lore Keeper's AI assistant understand who you are *right now* — not who you were last year, but who you are today.

**Why it matters:** As you grow and change, Lore Keeper adapts. If you're going through a difficult time, it responds with empathy. If you're in a creative phase, it matches that energy.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes your recent entries to understand your current state
- Identifies recurring themes (motifs) in your life
- Adapts its tone and responses to match your emotional state
- Tracks how your identity evolves over time

**Technical Details:**
- **Python core**: `lorekeeper/persona` derives persona versions, motifs, and tone based on identity, emotional slopes, and seasonal arcs
- **Behavior rules**: Lightweight heuristics translate persona state into deterministic tone and language guidance
- **API**: `/api/persona`, `/api/persona/update`, and `/api/persona/description` expose persona state to the web app and other services
- **UI**: `/persona` page visualizes the current persona, motifs, tone profile, and recent evolution

Architecture sketch:

```
Timeline → IdentityEngine → OmegaPersonaEngine → Persona Rules → API/Chat UI
                  ↑                 ↓
            SeasonEngine      Daily/Weekly Briefings
```

### Memory Explorer (formerly HQI)

**What it does:** A powerful search engine with smart query parsing that finds memories by meaning, not just keywords.

**Why it matters:** Traditional search looks for exact words. Memory Explorer understands what you're *really* asking for. Search "moments of clarity last spring" and it automatically extracts the date range, finds entries about breakthroughs, epiphanies, and sudden understanding — even if you never used those exact words.

**How it works:**
- **Smart Query Parser**: Extracts filters from natural language (date ranges, characters, tags, motifs)
- Combines multiple ways of understanding your memories (meaning, time, relationships)
- Searches across everything: journal entries, tasks, people, story arcs, and themes
- Ranks results by relevance, not just keyword matches
- Provides instant results with modal display showing timeline context and characters

**Technical Details:**
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Automatically detects date ranges ("last week", "spring 2023"), character mentions, tags, and motifs
- **Multi-modal search**: Search across memories, tasks, characters, arcs, and motifs in a single query
- **Filter support**: Filter results by type, tags, date ranges, and more
- **Unified ranking**: Combines semantic similarity, temporal proximity, and graph relationships
- **Result Modal**: Detailed view with memory content, timeline context, and character information

### Continuity Engine

**What it does:** Keeps your journal consistent and accurate, like a fact-checker for your life story.

**Why it matters:** Over time, you might write conflicting information (e.g., "I moved to Seattle in 2020" vs "I've been in Seattle since 2019"). The Continuity Engine catches these inconsistencies and helps you resolve them.

**How it works:**
- Tracks verified facts about your life (where you live, important dates, relationships)
- Detects when new entries conflict with established facts
- Monitors how your identity and relationships change over time
- Suggests ways to resolve conflicts when they arise

**Technical Details:**
- **Canonical Facts**: Maintains a registry of verified facts about characters, identity, locations, and events
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies factual and temporal conflicts between entries
- **Drift Analysis**: Tracks identity shifts, relationship changes, and narrative drift over time
- **Stability Metrics**: Measures consistency across characters, identity, projects, and locations
- **Merge Suggestions**: Proposes resolutions for detected conflicts
- **Continuity Reports**: Generates markdown reports summarizing canon, conflicts, and drift maps

The Python continuity engine (`lorekeeper/continuity/`) provides the core logic, while the API exposes state, conflicts, and reports.

### Lore Orchestrator

**What it does:** A central hub that brings together all of Lore Keeper's features in one place.

**Why it matters:** Instead of making separate requests for timeline, identity, characters, etc., the Orchestrator gives you everything you need in one response. It's like a dashboard that shows your entire life story at a glance.

**How it works:**
- Combines data from timeline, identity, continuity, characters, and more
- Provides a unified view of your lore state
- Formats everything consistently for easy consumption
- Powers the main dashboard and overview screens

**What You Get:**
- **Summary**: High-level overview of your lore state
- **Timeline**: Unified timeline with events, tasks, arcs, identity pulses, and drift alerts
- **Identity**: Current persona state, motifs, emotional trajectory, and drift warnings
- **Continuity**: Canon facts, conflicts, drift signals, and stability scores
- **Saga**: Era overview, narrative arcs, and cinematic chapters
- **Characters**: Character profiles, relationships, memories, closeness trends, and influence metrics
- **HQI**: Hypergraph Quantum Index search results
- **Fabric**: Memory fabric neighborhood visualization for a specific memory

**Technical Details:**
The orchestrator service (`apps/server/src/services/orchestratorService.ts`) coordinates data from multiple sources and formats responses for the frontend.

## Privacy & Security

**🔒 Using Your Real Memoir?** See [`PRIVACY_GUIDE.md`](./PRIVACY_GUIDE.md) for:
- How your data stays private (Row-Level Security, user isolation)
- Options for local development (local Supabase recommended)
- Why your memoir text won't interfere with builds
- Best practices for keeping your data secure

**Quick Summary:**
- ✅ All data is isolated by `user_id` - only you can see your data
- ✅ Use local Supabase for maximum privacy (data stays on your machine)
- ✅ Your memoir text is just data - it won't break the build process
- ✅ `.env` files are gitignored - your credentials stay private

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

**For Non-Technical Users:** Lore Keeper requires some technical setup. You'll need:
- A computer with Node.js installed
- An OpenAI API key (for AI features)
- A Supabase account (for data storage)
- Basic familiarity with terminal/command line

**For Developers:** Follow the steps below.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example`. This file contains your API keys and configuration.

3. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:server      # Runs on http://localhost:4000
   ```

4. **Start the Web Interface**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:web         # Runs on http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Required Environment Variables

**What are these?** These are secret keys that let Lore Keeper connect to external services (like OpenAI for AI features and Supabase for storing your data).

| Variable | What It Does | Where to Get It |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Enables AI features (chatbot, summaries, etc.) | [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Your database location | Supabase project settings |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Public database key | Supabase project settings |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Private database key (keep secret!) | Supabase project settings |
| `OPENAI_API_MODEL` | Which AI model to use (default: `gpt-4o-mini`) | Optional - uses default if not set |
| `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Model for semantic search (default: `text-embedding-3-small`) | Optional - uses default if not set |
| `X_API_BEARER_TOKEN` | Enables syncing X/Twitter posts (optional) | X Developer Portal |

**Important:** The backend will log warnings for missing environment variables but will attempt to start in development mode. Ensure all required variables are set for full functionality.

## Advanced Features

### Insight Engine

**What it does:** Analyzes your journal entries to find hidden patterns, themes, and insights about your life.

**Why it matters:** Sometimes you don't realize patterns until you see them. The Insight Engine might discover that you're happiest on weekends, or that certain people appear together frequently in your memories, or that you tend to write about creativity more in the spring.

**What It Finds:**
- **Patterns**: Groups of related entries (e.g., all entries about work stress)
- **Correlations**: Things that happen together (e.g., "exercise" and "good mood" often appear together)
- **Cycles**: Recurring rhythms in your life (e.g., you journal more on Mondays)
- **Motifs**: Frequently recurring themes or topics
- **Identity Shifts**: How you've changed over time (e.g., shifting from "student" to "professional")
- **Predictions**: Emerging themes that might become important

**Technical Details:**
The InsightEngine (`lorekeeper/insight_engine.py`) ingests timeline events, arcs, identity snapshots, and optional character/location metadata. It builds lightweight embeddings, performs quick clustering, and emits structured insights. Data classes for these outputs live in `lorekeeper/insights_types.py` so they can be reused across agents and UI panels.

## Insight API Routes

- `GET /api/insights/recent` — run the engine on the latest timeline events.
- `GET /api/insights/monthly/:year/:month` — scoped insights for a calendar month.
- `GET /api/insights/yearly/:year` — yearly rollups.
- `POST /api/insights/predict` — accept custom payloads (timeline/arcs/identity) to forecast upcoming arcs.

## Example Insight Output

```
{
  "patterns": [{"description": "Cluster 1 centers around running, health"}],
  "correlations": [{"variables": ["health", "running"], "confidence": 0.7}],
  "cycles": [{"period": "weekly", "evidence": ["3 entries on weekday 0"]}],
  "motifs": [{"motif": "running", "action_suggestion": "Collect representative stories"}],
  "identity_shifts": [{"shift": "Identity markers evolved: gained coach; less emphasis on runner"}],
  "predictions": [{"description": "Design is gaining momentum and may define the next arc."}]
}

-- ER-friendly view that blends characters, their memories, and outbound relationships
create or replace view public.character_knowledge_base as
select
  c.id as character_id,
  c.user_id,
  c.name,
  c.alias,

  cm.role as memory_role,
  cm.emotion as memory_emotion,
  cm.perspective,
  cm.summary as memory_summary,
  cr.target_character_id,
  cr.relationship_type,
  cr.closeness_score,
  cr.summary as relationship_summary
from public.characters c
left join public.character_memories cm
  on cm.character_id = c.id
left join public.character_relationships cr
  on cr.source_character_id = c.id;
```

- **Entity relationships**: `characters` are the primary nodes, `character_relationships` provide directional edges (ally, rival, mentor, sibling, etc.), and `character_memories` bridge characters to `journal_entries`/`chapters` so you can walk from people to specific story beats.
- **Shared memories**: the `character_memories` table and the `character_knowledge_base` view keep a queryable log of when characters appear together and how they felt/perspective-wise during a scene.
- **Indices**: each table includes user-scoped indexes to keep persona graphs and memory lookups fast at lore scale.

Grant `select/insert/update` on both tables to the `service_role` used by the API. Frontend reads data through the API so you do not need row level policies for now, but enabling RLS is recommended if you later expose Supabase directly to the client.

## Behind the Scenes: How Lore Keeper Maintains Itself

### Omega Agent Network

**What it does:** Autonomous "robots" that keep your journal organized, accurate, and up-to-date without you having to do anything.

**Why it matters:** Just like your phone updates apps automatically, Lore Keeper has agents that:
- Fix inconsistencies in your entries
- Enrich entries with missing information
- Keep your timeline accurate
- Refresh search indexes so everything stays fast
- Generate summaries automatically

**In Simple Terms:** Think of agents as helpful assistants that work 24/7 to keep your journal in perfect shape.

**Technical Details:**
The autonomous maintenance layer of Lore Keeper. Agents self-correct drift, enrich metadata, regenerate narratives, refresh embeddings, maintain identity arcs, and run nightly summaries.

### Mobile App (iOS/Android)

- React Native app with Expo
- **Background photo sync** - processes photos without storing them
- **Calendar event sync** - automatically logs calendar events to timeline
- Automatic location and EXIF metadata extraction
- Creates journal entries automatically from photos and calendar events
- No photo gallery UI - just syncs metadata to build your lore

### Python Package (`lorekeeper/`)

The project includes a Python package for advanced timeline management and narrative generation:

- **TimelineManager**: Append-only timeline system with year-sharded JSON storage
- **TimelineAgentInterface**: Agent-friendly interface for timeline operations
- **NarrativeStitcher**: Stitches together narrative arcs from timeline events
- **VoiceMemoIngestor**: Processes voice memos into structured timeline events
- **DriftAuditor**: Detects and prevents timeline drift
- **DailyBriefingEngine**: Generates daily executive briefings
- **WeeklyArcEngine**: Creates weekly narrative arcs
- **MonthlyArcEngine**: Generates monthly narrative summaries
- **ContinuityEngine** (`lorekeeper/continuity/`): Maintains canonical facts, detects conflicts, tracks drift, and generates continuity reports
  - **CanonicalRegistry**: Stores verified facts about characters, identity, locations, events
  - **Conflict Detection**: Identifies factual and temporal inconsistencies
  - **Drift Rules**: Tracks identity shifts and narrative drift over time
  - **Merge Rules**: Proposes conflict resolutions
  - **Continuity Reports**: Generates markdown reports summarizing canon, conflicts, and drift
- **LoreOrchestrator** (`lorekeeper/orchestrator/`): Unified orchestrator that coordinates all Lore Keeper subsystems
  - **OrchestratorSummary**: High-level overview combining timeline, identity, continuity, saga, and character data
  - **Context Schemas**: Structured data models for timeline, identity, continuity, character, saga, and fabric contexts
  - **HQI Integration**: Coordinates Hypergraph Quantum Index search
  - **Fabric Neighborhoods**: Generates memory fabric graphs for specific memories

See [`lorekeeper/README.md`](lorekeeper/README.md) for detailed Python package documentation.

### Memory Flow

1. User signs in through Supabase; session is reused for API calls.
2. **Neon Composer** can either save raw content or ask GPT to recall info. Keywords trigger automatic persistence server-side too. Arc, character, and tag suggestions enhance the writing experience.
3. **Calendar events** are synced from iPhone and automatically create journal entries with location, attendees, and context using GPT-4 to generate meaningful entries.
4. **Photos** are processed in the background - metadata creates journal entries without storing photos.
5. **X posts** can be synced via `/api/x/sync` - posts are imported and summarized into timeline entries.
6. **Tasks** can be extracted from chat messages or created manually, with optional Microsoft To Do sync. Task creation and completion automatically create timeline events and memory bridges.
7. **Daily Briefing** generates executive summaries combining recent activity, task status, narrative arcs, and drift detection.
8. Entries are stored with `date, content, tags, chapter_id, mood, summary, source, metadata` schema.
9. **Omni-Timeline** groups entries per chapter (and unassigned) and then by month, with multiple layers (events, tasks, arcs, identity, drift, tags, voice memos). Summary endpoints leverage GPT to condense a date range or a chapter arc.
10. **Chatbot queries** (`/api/chat`) use semantic search to find relevant memories and generate contextual responses based on your journal history.
11. **HQI Search** provides unified search across memories, tasks, characters, arcs, and motifs using Hypergraph Quantum Index ranking.
12. **Continuity Engine** continuously monitors entries for canonical facts, detects conflicts, tracks drift, and maintains consistency across your lore.
13. **Lore Orchestrator** coordinates data from timeline, identity, continuity, saga, characters, HQI, and fabric subsystems for unified access.
14. **Identity Pulse** tracks persona evolution, motifs, emotional trajectory, and drift warnings in real-time.
15. **Memory Fabric** visualizes connections between memories, characters, and tasks as an interactive 3D graph.
16. **Character Pages** track relationships, closeness over time, influence metrics, and shared memories.
17. **Saga Screen** presents your narrative as cinematic chapters with arcs and key moments.
18. **Corrections** archive original entries and create corrected versions, preserving full history.
19. **GitHub Integration** allows linking repositories and syncing commits/issues into your timeline as journal entries.
20. **Account Management** provides data export and deletion capabilities for user control.
21. **Onboarding** guides new users through setup with memory import options.
22. **Agent System** runs autonomous maintenance agents for drift correction, metadata enrichment, and narrative regeneration.
23. **Notebook Features** provide real-time arc suggestions, mood scoring, and memory previews while composing entries.
24. Node cron hook (`registerSyncJob`) is ready for future nightly summarization or webhook ingests.

### AutopilotEngine — AI Life Guidance

**What it does:** An AI coach that analyzes your life patterns and gives you personalized advice on what to do next.

**Why it matters:** Sometimes you're too close to your own life to see patterns. AutopilotEngine notices things like:
- "You're most productive in the mornings"
- "You tend to burn out after 3 weeks of intense work"
- "You're happiest when you exercise regularly"
- "This is a good time to focus on creative projects"

**What You Get:**
- **Daily guidance**: What to focus on today based on your patterns
- **Weekly strategy**: Top priorities for the week ahead
- **Monthly insights**: Big-picture course corrections
- **Burnout alerts**: Warnings when you're pushing too hard
- **Momentum tracking**: See when you're building positive habits

**In Simple Terms:** Like having a life coach who knows your entire history and can spot patterns you might miss.

**Technical Details:**
The AutopilotEngine blends timeline density, task pressure, identity motifs, and seasonal arcs to recommend what to do next. It detects cadence cycles, focus windows, identity shifts, and burnout/slump risk to generate daily, weekly, and monthly guidance.

**Available API routes:** `/api/autopilot/daily`, `/weekly`, `/monthly`, `/transition`, `/alerts`, `/momentum` (all support `?format=markdown`).

**CLI usage:** `python -m lorekeeper.autopilot daily --format json` (also supports `weekly`, `monthly`, `transition`, `alerts`, `momentum`). Pipe a JSON payload to stdin to override the demo data.

**Integration:** The Express router calls the Python AutopilotEngine via a bridge that streams timeline entries, task engine data, identity motifs, and arc metadata.

### Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**

- Ensure `.env` file exists in the project root directory
- Check that all required environment variables are set
- Verify port 4000 is not already in use: `lsof -i :4000`
- Check backend logs for specific error messages

**Chatbot not working:**

- Ensure backend server is running (`pnpm run dev:server`)
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly in `.env`
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure you're authenticated (Supabase session active)

**API requests failing:**

- Backend server must be running on `http://localhost:4000`
- Check that Supabase credentials are correct
- Verify authentication token is being sent with requests
